## Project Overview

This project aimed to improve patient care and identify cost-saving opportunities within a healthcare setting.  By analyzing a large dataset of patient records, the project sought to understand the impact of personalized care plans on recovery rates and identify potential billing inefficiencies.

## Data Source

The data source for this project consisted of over 50,000 patient records. (Provide more details if possible.  For example:)

* Type of data: (e.g., patient demographics, medical history, treatment information, billing data)
* Source of the data: (If it's publicly available, provide a link. If not, briefly describe how it was collected or generated. E.g., "Data provided by a partner hospital," or "Simulated data based on industry benchmarks.")

## Methodology

The project employed the following methodology:

1. **Data Extraction and Cleaning:** The patient data was extracted and cleaned using SQL. This likely included handling missing values, standardizing data formats, and ensuring data consistency.
2. **Data Modeling:**  A data model was designed to effectively organize and structure the data for analysis.  (Mention the type of data model used if known, e.g., relational, star schema).
3. **Advanced SQL Analysis:** Advanced SQL queries, including Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and window functions, were used to analyze the data and identify trends and patterns.
4. **Excel Analysis:** Excel was used for further analysis, visualization, and reporting of the findings. (Mention specific Excel features used if applicable, e.g., pivot tables, charts, formulas.)

## Key Findings

* **Personalized Care Impact:** The analysis revealed that personalized care plans resulted in a 25% higher recovery rate compared to standard treatment protocols.
* **Billing Inefficiencies:** The project identified billing inefficiencies in urban hospitals.  Patients in these hospitals had 15% longer stays without demonstrably improved outcomes. This suggested potential annual savings of over $120,000 through workflow optimization.

## Tools Used

* **SQL:** Used for data extraction, cleaning, transformation, and analysis.  Specific features used included Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and window functions.
* **Excel:** Used for data analysis, visualization, and reporting.
